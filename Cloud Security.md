# Cloud Security

## Cloud Security Questions
- Azure Web Application Gateway vs. Azure Front Door: Both provide load balancing, but the former is regional while the latter is global.
- SSL Offloading: Removing SSL-based encryption to enhance server performance.
- WAF OSI Layer: WAF operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model.
- WAF Managed Rule Example - Directory Traversal: Exploits insufficient security validation of file names to access files outside the web root folder.
- Impact of WAF Custom Rule Blocking Canadian Traffic: It could potentially block Canadian visitors, but there are ways around location-based blocks.
